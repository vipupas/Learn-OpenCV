# ‚ú® A contour is just a line that goes around the shape of an object.
# They help the computer understand what‚Äôs in a picture.
# They‚Äôre useful to find, detect, recognize, and follow objects.
# Without contours, a computer would just see millions of dots and go üòµ‚Äçüí´.

    # --- Preprocessing for Contours ---
    # Contours are typically found on binary images.
    # 1. Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # 2. Apply thresholding (or Canny edge detection is another common approach)
    ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV) # Inverse for black object on white background example

    # --- Finding Contours ---
    # cv2.findContours(image, mode, method)
    # image: Source binary image (8-bit single channel)
    # mode: Contour retrieval mode (e.g., cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL for outer contours, cv2.RETR_LIST for all)
    # method: Contour approximation method (e.g., cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE to compress horizontal/vertical/diagonal segments)

    # Note: findContours modifies the input image in some OpenCV versions.
    # Use a copy of the thresholded image if you need the original binary image later.
    contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # --- Drawing Contours ---
    # cv2.drawContours(image, contours, contourIdx, color, thickness)

    # contours: List of contours (output from findContours)
    # contourIdx: Index of the contour to draw (-1 to draw all)
    # color: Color of the contour (BGR tuple)
    # thickness: Thickness of the contour line (negative value like cv2.FILLED to fill the contour)

    # Draw all contours in green with thickness 2
    cv2.drawContours(img_contours, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
